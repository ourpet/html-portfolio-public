<h1>Oreo's Fave Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>AirBud</h3>
<p>
    I love me a fun sports movie and this one lives up to the hype! <br />
    It's so inspiring to see a fellow dog utilize his strengths to help his bro out on his team. Two paws way up!
</p>
<h3>12 Pups of Christmas</h3>
<p>
    I'm a huge fan of holiday movies like my mom and "bad" movies like my dad. This film made me laugh and cry and reminds me of how much I love my family.
</p>
<h3>Wicked</h3>
<p>
    Now ordinarily I would have picked another dog movie as one of my favorites, but when I saw Wicked it mesmerized me.
    The key element that put this in my top 3 was the animal rights storyline - that really hit me to my core! 
    And who doesn't like a good catchy musical?!
