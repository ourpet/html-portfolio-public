<p>Hi! My name is Oreo and I'm a Pomsky so I'm part Husky and part Pomeranian. Nice to meet you!</p>

<p>I am a very talented pup and can do many tricks including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sit</li>
  <li>Shake</li>
  <li>High Five</li>
  <li>Spin</li>
  <li>Bang</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure by now my adorableness and intellect has drawn you in. You may be wondering - is there any reason to not love me?!
  Of course not! But I guess my parents can get annoyed when I demand their attention by woofing or biting, eat anything and everything off the ground except my actual food, and completely destroy all my toys. <br />
</p>

<p>I may be a "little shit" as the humans refer to me, but everyone loves me because I am the cutest puppy in all the world!</p>
